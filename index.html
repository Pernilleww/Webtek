			<h3> Audience </h3>
			<p> The main audience of this site are stores who want to purchase textiles, wallpapers and carpets which can be sold to individuals. Individuals
				may access the site, but they can't purchase or order anything since the site is created for stores ordering large quantities.
				They can however look through the site to see what might be available to purchase in stores.
				Some of the challenges of creating this site might be the importance of showing all the products
				and information in a way so that the stores know what the business can supply and how they can order.
				It might also be challenging to show a lot of products from different <sup></sup>pliers in a consistent way throughout the site.
				This is because different suppliers might have different design visions and varying commercial material available.
